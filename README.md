# GustelifyPlaylistMgr

## Setup
API KEY can be found here:
https://developer.spotify.com/dashboard/

## Goal
This is an attempt at automatically sorting my Spotify music using the follwing scheme:
- Define Genre Playlists for all Songs I have liked (hearted)
- Once a heart is removed the follwing things happen:
-- song is removed from Genre playlist(s)
-- song will be put into a playlist with all other removed songs
- once a heart is added to a song the following things will happen:
-- queue song for adding to genre playlist (will probably be done manually)
-- remove song from deleted songs playlist
- adding new songs to genre playist will maybe be done via email? dunno yet
